# HexGame

## What is this "game"
It is a very simplified version of classic wargames played on a hexagonal map.

With this game you can move and fight the two armies on a map, in "hot seat" fashion, but there is not much to play with. No AI, no line of sight, very simple combat models, only one type of unit, no terrain elevation, no save game, no map editor or generator...

If you want to see what a real wargame looks like, try a good classic: [Steel Panthers 2](https://devga.me/tutorials/godot2d/).

## The real goal was to learn a game engine
This "game" is my second project with the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/).

Godot gives a lot of power in a very small package. The editor is fast, reliable and easy to use. Its scripting language can be learned quickly. The web offers many useful and clear tutorials and posts. At the end, I created my own little game in a very short time, with only the [the tutorial](https://devga.me/tutorials/godot2d/) as prior experience.

But what matters the most to someone who codes as an hobby: Godot was fun to work with.

Special thanks to the developers of [GUT](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut). There's a copy of it "embedded" in the repo, but that is because I did not have time to find a better way to manage the dependency.

## Careful!
I tried to keep the code clean-ish, but I tested only parts of it. Quality was not a priority.

The game does what it is supposed to do, but I feel that much of what I coded could be done with better techniques, if only I knew how to really use the engine. I certainly don't think this repo can be "production-level" work.
